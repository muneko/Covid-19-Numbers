Looking at the data differently

This area provides numbers you may find useful.

There are currently 3 files that repeat again and again.

us-running-total-031822.csv
us-daily-031822.csv
us50state031122.csv

us-running-total shows by month the number of deaths since April of 2020

us-daily shows a daily running total plus a number count for that day

us50state shows a list of the 50 US states, a running total for each state along with a daily count

In each case the amount of data is kept to a minimum.
